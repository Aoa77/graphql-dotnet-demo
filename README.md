# GraphQL API .NET 8 Demo
This is a GraphQL API demo built with .NET 8.0, based on this tutorial: https://softchris.github.io/pages/dotnet-graphql.html#demo-let-s-build-an-api.

The tutorial uses an older version of Joe McBride's [GraphQL NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphQL/7.8.0). This demo app has slightly modified code to reflect changes in the package's latest version.
